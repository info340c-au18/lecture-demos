Two sets of interactions
Click on something (it changes something), then click on something else and it changes that as well.

Not just toggling on and off

SLIDE 4
Checkin
Left and right 
left (i haven't started)
right (all done)
top (things are going okay)
bottom (terrible, confused)

For the other class, not as far as people would hope, but it's going okay for the most part.

What can I do to help?

Help debugging

Syntax features of ES6
Supported by most modern browsers
There are ways to get around
React will get around it because it already has the work around

These topics are all used by React. YOu need to know these things to user React

You are not required to use this syntax in Stage 2
But feel free to do so.

Something you will need for next week (Thursday and beyond)

This is a subset of what you will need to know for the assignments and the project.
These are the main points. The text has some additional detail you will want to read.

Slide 6
Classes
Have all of you done classes in Java

Let's do a 3 minute review of classes in Java

What's a class? Why do we make classes?

The metaphore for class : blueprint, template, defines state behavior for describing things.
Data and behaviors.

A unit in our program.

Declare a class - by using class keyword

Classes have fields, instance variables, attributes - we might mix and match all 3 of these terms
because they are all the same thing in this classes

Classes have constructors - which is the method we call when we want to make a new or instantiate a class.

If I have a person class, here's a template. If we want a person, the new operator is called on the class which calls constructor.

Generally the constructor takes parameters

We have methods that access the paramters which generally use the "this" keyword

this "t-his" 

We can access through gettors, we can modify through setters

Once we have an object we can pass that object into other methods and interact with other fields

So we have 2 new people and aida can say hello to bob.

SLIDE 7

Toggle back and forth between slide 6 (java) and slide 7 (jscript)

See how there are a limited number of differences

jscript still define groupings of data and behavior

Things that are different:
In java script we aren't going to declare variables ahead of time. java script don't have a type. we assume that they will gain whatever properties they want

Instead we need to assign values to the variables which tell what the types are.

These are generally assigned in th constructor

"Constructor" keyword. This is better than in Java

public void in java. in jscript its much clearer

Getters and setters
Look alot like java functions, but they don't have the function keyword in front of them

Anytime we define a method inside the class block, we just put down the name of the method. no "public void" there's no access modifiers and no return types. Here's the name 
of the function.

Still use the this keyword

We still use the "new" keyword in jscript.

Almost the exact same syntax as java with a few differences. mostly getting rid of access modifiers. In jscript everything is public.

So getters are useful if you want encapsulation. But it's true that the data is public so you don't absolutely need them, but if you 
are manipulating the attributes (like concatenating first and last name in a getter for name), then it's nice to have a getter.

We won't do alot of getters in this class.



NOW LETS MAKE A CLASS

Demo 

SLIDE 8

Here's the card

There are two methods:

The constructor - note it's called a constructor

The render() method - Using jQuery :
    1. we create a new div with class of "card"
    2. we set the text to be the this.message
    3. we return the cardDiv

Then we can use this class in //main work
    1. We create a new card - notice using the new keyword
    2. Then we call the card.render() method
    3. We use jQuery to append the rendered Card to the DOM at the #content element using the CSS selector


This is useful because if we want to make lots of different cards we can do so quickly


SLIDE 9
ES6 Demo 2

So now lets use our class to do just that. 

Create an array of card objects

Use the forEach to render each Card

See how they render!

SLIDE 10
Example 3

Now let's show how we can keep state of attributes within the object
Add another parameter "initial" to the argument list
Add clickedCount to the object (notice we don't declare it in jscript, we just assign it and it becomes real)

Add some additional formatting to the render function to include the "this.ClickCount"

And it works. It doesn't currently show the clicked count, but instead the index, but that's okay


SLIDE 11
Now that we keep track of the amount of time they've been clicked,
Let's add the code to actually do that

When we click on the item we get an unexpected result "You clicked on undefined"

Why???

Doesn't it seem like it should be working? Anything obvious? It's not that clearn


SLIDE 12

Aside: Working with this

In JavaScript, functions are called on objects. In a function, this is a "local" variable that is 
implicitly assigned that object as its value.

Anytime you call a function, you are always calling function in some way.
That thing is what is assigned to the "this" variable.

This gets weird because funtions are variables and can move around and be assigned

Look at this silly dog Example

Both objects have bark functions

When calling doggy.bark it does the "woof"

doggo.bark it "yips"

But you can actually move them around. 

So you can see that we can reassign and the next time we are using the reassigned function, but 
will still use the attribute from the other object.


So whenever you call a function and you want to access the this variable, which object are you calling that 
function on?

SLIDE 13

Person I want to access this person's name, I'm doing it inside of a function
Which function am I don't this inside of?

This function is an anonymous function... what "this" is it referring to? It's an anonymous function?
It might not be obvious to you, but the anonymous function is not actually part of the class. 
So the "this" is not actually the object.

When using anonymous callback functions, you don't actually have access to the this variable for the
object

Thus in the example when we try to access the "this.message" in the demo, there isn't a this.message 
as part of the anonymous function. That's why we get "undefined". The anonymous function is not part of the class
It's actually called on the global "window" variable which doesn't have a .message method... and if it did
you'd see a different issue (bug)


So in the code

when we log out this in the code... you'll see that you get the DOM element when clicked on
instead of the object

SLIDE 14
Arrow functions

The cleanest way to fix this is to use something called an Arrow function.

to make sure we don't lose access to the "this" we use this syntactic shortcut.

It's a bit painful because it's kind of hard to read. ES6 allows us to do this. it's new

Anonymous function. Arrows functions allow you to get rid of the "function" 

This => replaces the "function"

We can also make it more concise

If there is only one line of code, we don't need the block '{}'

And since we don't have angle brackets, we can also delete the return statement

If you don't have the block or return statement, the assumption is whatever this single expression is, is the 
return value.

You can take that block of code and have this concise body. More painful to read, but cool.

SLIDE 15
Arrow functions 2

Further
if you have single parameter then putting the parenthis is optional 

Don't do this. Put the '()' to make it more readible

If there are no parameters you can have arrow functions that look like this 
let foo = () => 'foo '+paramters

looks like you have a random set of parens floating in space


You should aways be using arrow functions particulaly for anonymous callback functions.

Fix scoping issues for the "this"

Syntactical transformation

Go back to the map function... turn it into an arrow function.

The way the interpreter looks at arrows is special. They are always called on their
parent 'this' context. 

the 'this' is the same value. it gets passed automatically.

when we use arrow functions we don't change the value of the this... we can automatically pass in the 'this'.

It's still an anonymous call back. It's a specific kind of an anonymous call back function.

So now when we go back to the cards... the 'this' is correct.


SLIDE 18
ES5 Demo 5

In practice, we might have other things we want to do like have a click count and increment by 1
So when I click on this card, we can increment

using this.incrementCount()


In java if you leave off the "this". it'll look for the variable in the class

In jScript you have to be explicit. it looks for a local variable if you don't put this.


Use the arrow syntax

The arrow 'wraps' a function to make sure we get the 'this' passed along

The syntax is annoying, but it works.

SlIDE 19
Lots to do. 

The middle problem will be covered in the lab. Ian's gonna do it with you. come to lab
