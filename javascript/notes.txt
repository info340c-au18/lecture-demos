Slide 1
There are 3 languages we are learning in this class: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
It might seem like React is a 4th language, but it's still javascript

java script allows us to have interactivity on the page
Hover is about the most interactive thing we can get with basic HTML

Java and Javascript are not the same. They really have nothing to do with each other. JavaScript was named with "Java" in the title as a marketing ploy.

Java Script is officially an implementation of the ECMAScript specification. 

It's labeled with the "ES" prefix with it's versioning. ES5 is Java5.

This class is focused on ES5. It's supported by all modern browsers. 

2 ways of executing code written in javascript:
1) in the browser
2) on the command line with node.js

I'll be demoing within the browser

You include the <script> tag to include javascript
It's possible to embed script directly within the tag, but not recommended and generally used for quick tests.
